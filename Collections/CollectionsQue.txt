1️⃣ What is the difference between Array, ArrayList, and LinkedList?
Feature	Array	ArrayList	LinkedList
Size	Fixed (static)	Dynamic (resizable)	Dynamic (resizable)
Access Time	O(1) (direct access)	O(1) (direct access by index)	O(n) (sequential access)
Insertion/Deletion	Expensive (need manual handling)	Faster than Array for add/remove at end, slow in middle	Fast insertion/removal anywhere (O(1) if node known)
Internal Structure	Contiguous memory	Dynamic array	Doubly linked nodes
2️⃣ What are the key interfaces in the Java Collections Framework?

Collection: Root interface for groups of objects. Has methods like add(), remove(), size().

Subinterfaces:

List: Ordered collection, allows duplicates (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList)

Set: No duplicates allowed (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet)

Queue: For holding elements prior to processing (e.g., PriorityQueue)

Map: Not a Collection, but stores key-value pairs (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap)

3️⃣ When will you choose HashMap over TreeMap?
Feature	HashMap	TreeMap
Order	No order (unsorted)	Sorted order (natural or comparator)
Performance	Faster (O(1) avg for get/put)	Slower (O(log n) for get/put)
Null keys	Allows one null key	Does NOT allow null keys

Choose HashMap if speed is important and sorting is not needed.

4️⃣ What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
Feature	HashSet	TreeSet
Order	No guaranteed order	Sorted order (natural/comparator)
Performance	Faster (O(1) add/remove)	Slower (O(log n) add/remove)
Null elements	Allows one null element	Does NOT allow null elements
Duplicates	Not allowed	Not allowed
5️⃣ Can you store null in HashSet, HashMap, TreeSet, and TreeMap?
Collection	Allows Null?	Notes
HashSet	Yes, one null allowed	Only one null allowed
HashMap	Yes, one null key allowed	Also allows multiple null values
TreeSet	No	Throws NullPointerException
TreeMap	No	Throws NullPointerException
6️⃣ What is the difference between List, Set, and Map?
Interface	Allows duplicates?	Stores key-value pairs?	Maintains insertion order?
List	Yes	No	Yes (ArrayList, LinkedList)
Set	No	No	Depends (e.g., LinkedHashSet yes)
Map	Keys no, values yes	Yes	Depends (LinkedHashMap yes)
7️⃣ What is the internal structure of a HashMap?

Uses an array of buckets, where each bucket is a linked list or balanced tree (for many collisions).

Hashing: The key’s hashCode() is used to find the bucket index.

Collision: When two keys have the same hash, they are stored in the same bucket — resolved by chaining (linked list or tree).

Since Java 8, if bucket size exceeds threshold, linked list converts to balanced tree (Red-Black tree) for better performance.

8️⃣ What’s the difference between equals() and hashCode()? Why are they important in collections?

equals() checks logical equality of objects.

hashCode() returns an integer hash, used for placing objects in hash-based collections (HashMap, HashSet).

Contract: If two objects are equal (equals() returns true), their hashCode() must be the same.

If not, collections like HashMap will malfunction (e.g., fail to find keys).

9️⃣ You want to store unique student names in the order they were added. Which collection will you use?

Answer: LinkedHashSet

Maintains insertion order

No duplicates allowed

🔟 You are implementing a leaderboard system, where you want to:

Store player names and scores

Sort players by their score automatically

Answer: Use a TreeMap with scores as keys, or PriorityQueue with custom comparator

TreeMap<Integer, String> — keys sorted by score

Or PriorityQueue to keep top scores efficiently

1️⃣1️⃣ What is ConcurrentHashMap? How is it different from HashMap?

ConcurrentHashMap is a thread-safe version of HashMap.

Allows concurrent read and write by multiple threads without locks on the entire map.

Internally uses segment locks or finer-grained locking.

HashMap is not thread-safe — concurrent modification may cause data corruption.

1️⃣2️⃣ Can a HashMap have duplicate keys? What happens when you put the same key twice?

No duplicate keys allowed.

If you put a key that already exists, the old value is replaced with the new value.

Example:

map.put("A", 1);
map.put("A", 2); // replaces 1 with 2

1️⃣3️⃣ What's the difference between ArrayList and Vector?
Feature	ArrayList	Vector
Thread-safe?	No	Yes (synchronized)
Performance	Faster (non-synchronized)	Slower (due to synchronization)
Legacy?	Part of Java Collections Framework	Legacy class, old API
1️⃣4️⃣ What is the time complexity of get() in:
Collection	get() Time Complexity
ArrayList	O(1) (direct access by index)
LinkedList	O(n) (sequential traversal)
HashMap	O(1) avg (hash + bucket)
